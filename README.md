Ionic Hybrid App

-----

An app still in development, not finished


The goal is to build an app for a locate chat.

What is done, is an ionic app inside the 'www' folder.

In the 'controllers.js' file you'll have to configure an URL with your full chat webpage functionning independently (instead of the 4 times variable present inside "http://YOURDOMAINURL/chat" ). Later I will share this chat webpage made in PHP.
