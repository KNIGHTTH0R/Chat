## Ionic Hybrid App

### An app still in development, to be continued

The goal is to build an app for a locate chat.

What is done, is an ionic framework app here inside the 'www' folder.

In the 'controllers.js' file you'll have to configure an URL with your full chat webpage functionning independently (instead of the 4 times variable present inside "http://YOURDOMAINURL/chat" ). I will share this chat webpage made in PHP (this is now functional and in the other repository "webchat").
